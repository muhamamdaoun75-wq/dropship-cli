# dropship-cli

AI-powered autonomous dropshipping operator. Like Claude Code, but instead of writing code, it runs your dropshipping business from the terminal.

Connect your Shopify store, point it at CJ Dropshipping, and let AI agents handle product sourcing, pricing, fulfillment, revenue protection, customer support, and more.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g dropship-cli
```

Or clone and link locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youruser/dropship-cli.git
cd dropship-cli
npm install
npm link
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Connect your store
dropship connect

# 2. See what you're working with
dropship status

# 3. Find products to sell
dropship scout

# 4. Source a product from CJ and import to Shopify
dropship source "LED desk lamp"

# 5. Talk to AI about your business
dropship chat

# 6. Let AI run everything
dropship autopilot
```

## How It Works

Every command is an AI agent powered by Claude. Each agent has specialized tools that connect to your Shopify store and CJ Dropshipping. The agent sees your real data, reasons about it, and takes action.

```
You run a command
    |
    v
AI agent receives task + tools
    |
    v
Claude analyzes your store data
    |
    v
Calls tools (Shopify API, CJ API)
    |
    v
Iterates until task is complete
    |
    v
Reports results to your terminal
```

`dropship autopilot` orchestrates all agents — it checks business state, decides what needs attention, and runs the right agents in the right order. Every 15 minutes.
